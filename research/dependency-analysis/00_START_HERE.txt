                    COMPLETE DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS
                       open-s3 Project (S3 TUI)
================================================================================

START HERE: Read this file first, then choose your path based on your role.

================================================================================
WHAT THIS IS
================================================================================

A comprehensive analysis of ALL dependencies in the open-s3 project, identifying:
- What's broken (zero dependencies)
- What's missing (~122 relationships)  
- How to fix it (122 links to add)
- Why it matters (can't prioritize work)

Analysis Date: November 15, 2025
Issues Analyzed: 77 (9 epics + 68 tasks)
Documents: 4 comprehensive guides

================================================================================
THE PROBLEM (IN 60 SECONDS)
================================================================================

Current State:
✗ 0 dependencies between tasks
✗ "bd ready" shows all 68 tasks as ready (meaningless)
✗ "bd blocked" shows nothing
✗ Can't identify critical paths
✗ Type safety not enforced

What's Missing:
✗ 68 parent-child epic-task links
✗ 14 type system foundation blocks
✗ 6 save operation sequence links
✗ 12 S3 adapter foundation blocks
✗ Plus ~22 more feature dependencies

Impact:
- New developers can't see what to work on
- Could implement tasks in wrong order
- Type safety violations possible
- No way to detect bottlenecks

KEY STATISTICS
================================================================================

Current State:
  Dependencies:         0 (ZERO!)
  Tasks with deps:      0/68
  Epic-task links:      0/68
  Circular deps:        0 ✓

Target State:
  Dependencies:         122+
  Tasks with deps:      50+/68
  Epic-task links:      68/68
  Circular deps:        0 ✓

Most Critical Missing Dependencies:
  Type system (bd-2cl, bd-38p):         14 links
  Save operation flow:                   6+ links
  S3 adapter foundation:                12 links
  UI structure:                          5 links
  Navigation system:                     8 links

================================================================================
THE 5 CRITICAL ISSUES (HIGH LEVEL)
================================================================================

1. ZERO Epic→Task Relationships
   Current: Tasks don't link to epics (all 68 orphaned)
   Fix: Add parent-child link from each task to its epic
   Impact: HIGH - breaks bd ready/blocked commands

2. Save Operation Flow Unordered
   Current: 10 tasks with no sequence dependencies
   Fix: Add linear chain: bd-2fk → bd-bga → bd-2pd → bd-19s → bd-0j3 → bd-ret
   Impact: CRITICAL - entire save system is blocked

3. Type System Not Foundation
   Current: bd-2cl and bd-38p have zero active dependencies
   Fix: bd-2cl blocks [9 tasks], bd-38p blocks [5 tasks]
   Impact: HIGH - could implement dependents before dependency

4. UI Layer Structure Missing
   Current: 9 UI tasks appear completely independent
   Fix: bd-xxq → bd-807, bd-0sv, bd-ziy (hierarchical)
   Impact: HIGH - component relationships unclear

5. S3 Adapter Foundation Missing
   Current: 9 S3 methods have no setup prerequisite
   Fix: bd-0fg blocks [6 S3 methods], bd-3sd blocks same
   Impact: MEDIUM - could implement methods before setup

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION QUICK START
================================================================================

If you want to fix this RIGHT NOW:

Step 1: Read QUICK_REFERENCE.md (20 min)
Step 2: Follow the "Quick Implementation Checklist" (4-6 hours)
Step 3: Use bd dep command to add dependencies:
        bd dep --from <blocker> --to <blocked> --type blocks
Step 4: Verify with bd ready/blocked/show commands
Step 5: Check VERIFICATION CHECKLIST in README.md

Total time: 4-7 hours for complete implementation

1. REVIEW (Pick your role above ↑)
2. READ the recommended documents for your role
3. UNDERSTAND the 5 critical issues
4. APPROVE whether to implement (recommended: YES)
5. IMPLEMENT using Tier 1/2/3 approach
6. VERIFY using the checklist
7. DOCUMENT what you learned

================================================================================
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: Should I read all 4 documents?
A: Only if you want. Pick one based on your role above. README.md links them.

Q: How long will this take to implement?
A: 4-6 hours for Tier 1 (most critical). 7-10 hours for all three tiers.

Q: What if we get dependencies wrong?
A: No risk. bd structure is acyclic. You can delete and re-add anytime.

Q: Can we do this incrementally?
A: Yes! Add parent-child links first (easiest). Then critical paths.

Q: Why is this important?
A: Because "bd ready" currently shows all 68 tasks as ready when only 10-15
   actually are. New developers have no way to know what to work on first.

Q: What if we don't fix this?
A: bd tools won't work properly. You'll have no critical path visibility.
   Tasks could be done in wrong order. Type safety not enforced.

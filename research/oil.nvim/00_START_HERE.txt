KEY FINDINGS IN 30 SECONDS
================================================================================

Oil.nvim uses a genius pattern: "Treat filesystem as an editable buffer"
- Users browse directories, edit like text, save with :w
- Uses adapter pattern (same UI, different backends)
- Only 16 default keybindings but they're brilliant
- Confirmation dialogs show planned operations before commit
- Perfect reference for S3 explorer design

WHY IT MATTERS FOR OPEN-S3:
✅ Adapter architecture directly applies to S3
✅ Safety-first design (crucial for cloud operations)
✅ Cross-directory operations (critical for multi-bucket work)
✅ Vim users will immediately understand the UI
✅ Clean separation of concerns (UI vs. backend)

MAIN CHALLENGE:
⚠️  S3 is async (network latency) - oil is instant (local filesystem)
    BUT: Oil already has progress windows and async patterns we can reuse

BOTTOM LINE:
With this research, Phase 1 MVP (4-6 weeks) will feel natural to Vim users
while providing powerful S3 management capabilities.

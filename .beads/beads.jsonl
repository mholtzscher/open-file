Install Renovate GitHub App: https://github.com/apps/renovate\n2. Create renovate.json in repository root\n3. Renovate creates onboarding PR to confirm config\n\n### Recommended Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json\",\n  \"extends\": [\n    \"config:recommended\",\n    \":automergeMinor\",\n    \":automergeDigest\",\n    \"schedule:weekends\"\n  ],\n  \"labels\": [\"dependencies\"],\n  \"platformAutomerge\": true,\n  \"packageRules\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Group all non-major devDependencies\",\n      \"matchDepTypes\": [\"devDependencies\"],\n      \"matchUpdateTypes\": [\"minor\", \"patch\"],\n      \"groupName\": \"dev dependencies (non-major)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Group TypeScript and type definitions\",\n      \"matchPackagePatterns\": [\"^typescript\", \"^@types/\"],\n      \"groupName\": \"TypeScript\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Group testing packages\",\n      \"matchPackagePatterns\": [\"vitest\", \"jest\", \"@testing-library\"],\n      \"groupName\": \"testing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Group AWS SDK packages\",\n      \"matchPackagePatterns\": [\"^@aws-sdk/\"],\n      \"groupName\": \"AWS SDK\",\n      \"schedule\": [\"before 5am on Sunday\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Automerge patch updates\",\n      \"matchUpdateTypes\": [\"patch\"],\n      \"automerge\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Dont automerge major updates\",\n      \"matchUpdateTypes\": [\"major\"],\n      \"automerge\": false\n    }\n  ],\n  \"prHourlyLimit\": 2,\n  \"prConcurrentLimit\": 10,\n  \"dependencyDashboard\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Key Features of This Config\n\n- **Weekend scheduling** - Updates run on weekends to minimize disruption\n- **Grouped PRs** - DevDeps, TypeScript, testing, and AWS SDK grouped separately\n- **Smart auto-merge** - Patch updates auto-merge; major updates require review\n- **Rate limiting** - Max 2 PRs/hour, 10 concurrent to avoid PR flood\n\n### When Dependabot Might Be Preferred\n\n- Maximum simplicity needed\n- GitHub-native experience preferred\n- Org already standardized on Dependabot","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"chore","created_at":"2025-11-25T15:51:28.188097543-06:00","updated_at":"2025-11-25T16:46:10.035088943-06:00","closed_at":"2025-11-25T16:46:10.035088943-06:00"}

The recommended pattern is `createAdapterRegistry()` for explicit DI.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Audit Usage (Pre-removal)\n1. Search codebase for usage of deprecated functions\n2. Document any remaining usages\n3. Update any internal code still using deprecated functions\n\n### Phase 2: Add Runtime Warnings (v1.x)\nAdd console.warn on first call to deprecated functions:\n```typescript\nlet warnedGlobal = false;\nexport function getAdapterRegistry(): AdapterRegistry {\n  if (!warnedGlobal \u0026\u0026 process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n    console.warn(\n      'getAdapterRegistry() is deprecated. Use createAdapterRegistry() for explicit DI.'\n    );\n    warnedGlobal = true;\n  }\n  // existing implementation\n}\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Remove Exports (v2.0)\nIn major version bump:\n1. Remove `getAdapterRegistry` export\n2. Remove `registerAdapter` export\n3. Remove `getAdapter` export  \n4. Remove `registerS3` export\n5. Keep internal `globalRegistry` for backwards compat if needed via opt-in\n\n### Alternative: Lazy Registration\nInstead of removing, make MockAdapter registration lazy:\n```typescript\nexport class AdapterRegistry {\n  private adapters: Map\u003cstring, Adapter\u003e = new Map();\n  private factories: Map\u003cstring, () =\u003e Adapter\u003e = new Map();\n\n  constructor() {\n    // Register factory instead of instance\n    this.factories.set('mock', () =\u003e new MockAdapter());\n  }\n\n  getAdapter(name: string): Adapter {\n    // Check instances first\n    let adapter = this.adapters.get(name);\n    if (adapter) return adapter;\n    \n    // Check factories\n    const factory = this.factories.get(name);\n    if (factory) {\n      adapter = factory();\n      this.adapters.set(name, adapter);\n      return adapter;\n    }\n    \n    throw new Error(`Adapter not found: ${name}`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n- src/adapters/registry.ts\n\n## Testing\n- Verify createAdapterRegistry() still works\n- Verify existing tests pass\n- Add deprecation warning tests (Phase 2)\n\n## Migration Guide (for CHANGELOG)\n```markdown\n### Breaking Changes (v2.0)\n- Removed `getAdapterRegistry()` - use `createAdapterRegistry()`\n- Removed `registerAdapter()` - use `registry.register()`\n- Removed `getAdapter()` - use `registry.getAdapter()`\n- Removed `registerS3()` - use `registry.registerS3()`\n```\n\n## Effort Estimate\nLow (30 minutes for Phase 2, additional time for Phase 3 in major release)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:32:40.053783149-06:00","updated_at":"2025-11-26T20:49:41.990701-06:00","closed_at":"2025-11-26T20:49:41.990701-06:00"}

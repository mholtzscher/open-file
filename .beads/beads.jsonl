For directories with 10,000+ files, this causes:\n- Slow initial render\n- High memory usage\n- Laggy scrolling\n- Poor user experience\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Step 1: Research Virtual Scrolling Options\nOptions for React/Ink terminal UI:\n1. **Custom implementation** - Build windowing logic\n2. **Adapt existing libraries** - Modify react-window concepts for terminal\n3. **OpenTUI built-in** - Check if OpenTUI has virtualization support\n\n### Step 2: Design Windowing System\n```typescript\n// src/hooks/useVirtualList.ts\ninterface VirtualListOptions {\n  totalItems: number;\n  visibleHeight: number;  // Terminal rows available\n  itemHeight: number;     // Usually 1 for terminal\n  overscan: number;       // Extra items to render above/below\n}\n\ninterface VirtualListResult {\n  startIndex: number;\n  endIndex: number;\n  offsetTop: number;\n  visibleItems: number;\n}\n\nexport function useVirtualList({\n  totalItems,\n  visibleHeight,\n  itemHeight = 1,\n  overscan = 5,\n}: VirtualListOptions): VirtualListResult {\n  const [scrollOffset, setScrollOffset] = useState(0);\n  \n  const visibleItems = Math.ceil(visibleHeight / itemHeight);\n  const startIndex = Math.max(0, Math.floor(scrollOffset / itemHeight) - overscan);\n  const endIndex = Math.min(\n    totalItems - 1,\n    startIndex + visibleItems + overscan * 2\n  );\n  \n  return {\n    startIndex,\n    endIndex,\n    offsetTop: startIndex * itemHeight,\n    visibleItems,\n    setScrollOffset,\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create VirtualList Component\n```typescript\n// src/ui/virtual-list-react.tsx\nimport { Box, Text } from '@anthropic/opentui';\n\ninterface VirtualListProps\u003cT\u003e {\n  items: T[];\n  height: number;\n  renderItem: (item: T, index: number) =\u003e ReactNode;\n  scrollOffset: number;\n  onScroll?: (offset: number) =\u003e void;\n}\n\nexport function VirtualList\u003cT\u003e({\n  items,\n  height,\n  renderItem,\n  scrollOffset,\n}: VirtualListProps\u003cT\u003e) {\n  const { startIndex, endIndex, offsetTop } = useVirtualList({\n    totalItems: items.length,\n    visibleHeight: height,\n  });\n  \n  const visibleItems = items.slice(startIndex, endIndex + 1);\n  \n  return (\n    \u003cBox flexDirection=\"column\" height={height}\u003e\n      {/* Spacer for items above viewport */}\n      {offsetTop \u003e 0 \u0026\u0026 \u003cBox height={offsetTop} /\u003e}\n      \n      {/* Visible items */}\n      {visibleItems.map((item, i) =\u003e (\n        \u003cBox key={startIndex + i}\u003e\n          {renderItem(item, startIndex + i)}\n        \u003c/Box\u003e\n      ))}\n      \n      {/* Spacer for items below viewport */}\n      \u003cBox flexGrow={1} /\u003e\n    \u003c/Box\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Integrate with BufferView\n```typescript\n// src/ui/buffer-view-react.tsx\nexport function BufferView({ entries, cursor, height }: Props) {\n  // Calculate scroll offset based on cursor position\n  const scrollOffset = useMemo(() =\u003e {\n    const cursorRow = cursor;\n    const halfHeight = Math.floor(height / 2);\n    return Math.max(0, cursorRow - halfHeight);\n  }, [cursor, height]);\n  \n  return (\n    \u003cVirtualList\n      items={entries}\n      height={height}\n      scrollOffset={scrollOffset}\n      renderItem={(entry, index) =\u003e (\n        \u003cEntryRow\n          entry={entry}\n          isSelected={selection.has(entry.id)}\n          isCursor={index === cursor}\n        /\u003e\n      )}\n    /\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Keep Cursor in View\n```typescript\n// Ensure cursor is always visible\nfunction keepCursorInView(\n  cursor: number,\n  scrollOffset: number,\n  visibleHeight: number\n): number {\n  const minVisible = scrollOffset;\n  const maxVisible = scrollOffset + visibleHeight - 1;\n  \n  if (cursor \u003c minVisible) {\n    return cursor;

Ink captures raw key event\n2. globalKeyboardDispatcher receives event\n3. s3-explorer handleKeyPress checks mode and dialogs\n4. useKeyboardEvents provides mode-specific handlers\n5. useKeybindings maps keys to actions\n6. keybindings.ts defines default bindings\n\n### Step 2: Design Unified Dispatcher\n```typescript\n// src/hooks/useKeyboardDispatcher.ts\nimport { useCallback, useRef } from 'react';\nimport { EditMode } from '../types/edit-mode';\nimport { KeyboardKey, KeyAction } from '../types/keyboard';\nimport { defaultKeybindings } from '../ui/keybindings';\n\ninterface

registerAction = useCallback((action: KeyAction, handler: () =\u003e void) =\u003e {\n    actionHandlersRef.current.set(action, handler);\n    return () =\u003e actionHandlersRef.current.delete(action);\n  }, []);\n  \n  // Main dispatch function\n  const dispatch = useCallback((key: KeyboardKey) =\u003e {\n    // Skip if dialog is handling input\n    if (isDialogOpen) return false;\n    \n    // Get binding for current mode\n    const modeBindings = keybindings[mode];\n    const action = modeBindings?.get(keyToString(key));\n    \n    if (action) {\n      const handler = actionHandlersRef.current.get(action);\n      if (handler) {\n        handler();\n        return true;\n      }\n    }\n    \n    return false;\n  }, [mode, isDialogOpen, keybindings]);\n  \n  return { dispatch, registerAction };\n}\n\nfunction keyToString(key: KeyboardKey): string {\n  const parts: string[] = [];\n  if (key.ctrl) parts.push('ctrl');\n  if (key.meta) parts.push('meta');\n  if (key.shift) parts.push('shift');\n  parts.push(key.name);\n  return parts.join('+');\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Define Action Types\n```typescript\n// src/types/keyboard.ts\nexport type KeyAction =\n  // Navigation\n  | 'cursor:up'\n  | 'cursor:down'\n  | 'cursor:top'\n  | 'cursor:bottom'\n  | 'cursor:pageUp'\n  | 'cursor:pageDown'\n  // Entry operations\n  | 'entry:open'\n  | 'entry:back'\n  | 'entry:delete'\n  | 'entry:rename'\n  | 'entry:copy'\n  | 'entry:paste'\n  // Mode changes\n  | 'mode:search'\n  | 'mode:command'\n  | 'mode:visual'\n  | 'mode:normal'\n  // Dialogs\n  | 'dialog:help'\n  | 'dialog:sort'\n  | 'dialog:upload'\n  // Selection\n  | 'select:toggle'\n  | 'select:all'\n  | 'select:none';\n```\n\n### Step 4: Create Keybinding Registry\n```typescript\n// src/ui/keybindings.ts (refactored)\nexport type KeybindingMap = Map\u003cEditMode, Map\u003cstring, KeyAction\u003e\u003e;\n\nexport const defaultKeybindings: KeybindingMap = new Map([\n  [EditMode.Normal, new Map([\n    ['j', 'cursor:down'],\n    ['k', 'cursor:up'],\n    ['g', 'cursor:top'],  // gg handled specially\n    ['G', 'cursor:bottom'],\n    ['l', 'entry:open'],\n    ['h', 'entry:back'],\n    ['return', 'entry:open'],\n    ['d', 'entry:delete'],\n    ['r', 'entry:rename'],\n    ['y', 'entry:copy'],\n    ['p', 'entry:paste'],\n    ['/', 'mode:search'],\n    [':', 'mode:command'],\n    ['v', 'mode:visual'],\n    ['?', 'dialog:help'],\n    ['s', 'dialog:sort'],\n    ['u', 'dialog:upload'],\n    ['space', 'select:toggle'],\n  ])],\n  [EditMode.Visual, new Map([\n    ['escape', 'mode:normal'],\n    ['j', 'cursor:down'],\n    ['k', 'cursor:up'],\n    // Visual mode bindings\n  ])],\n  // Other modes...\n]);\n```\n\n### Step 5: Wire Up in S3Explorer\n```typescript\n// src/ui/s3-explorer.tsx\nfunction S3Explorer() {\n  const { dispatch, registerAction } = useKeyboardDispatcher({\n    mode: bufferState.mode,\n    isDialogOpen: dialog.activeDialog !== null,\n  });\n  \n  // Register all action handlers\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    const unregister = [\n      registerAction('cursor:down', () =\u003e bufferState.moveCursor(1)),\n      registerAction('cursor:up', () =\u003e bufferState.moveCursor(-1)),\n      registerAction('entry:open', handleOpenEntry),\n      registerAction('entry:delete', handleDelete),\n      // ... etc\n    ];\n    return () =\u003e unregister.forEach(fn =\u003e fn());\n  }, [registerAction, bufferState, handleOpenEntry, handleDelete]);\n  \n  // Connect to keyboard input\n  useInput((input, key) =\u003e dispatch({ name: key.name, ...key }));\n}\n```\n\n## Files to Create\n- src/hooks/useKeyboardDispatcher.ts\n-
